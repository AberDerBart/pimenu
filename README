PiMenu
======

This is a simple fullscreen menu system written in Python TKInter. It has been
developed with a Raspberry Pi Touchscreen in mind and is optimized for small
screens (320x240 is assumed).

The design is inspired by Windows 8's Metro design. Tiles can either open new
pages of tiles or execute the action script (pimenu.sh).

All tiles are configured in pimenu.yaml

On the raspberry, install python-yaml:

  sudo apt-get install python-yaml

The install comes wih a bunch of icons.
